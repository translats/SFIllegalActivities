# SFDrugs
This is a Slimefun addon, for 1.19.2. There is a progressive
story line to this plugin. This plugin will occassionally
spawn incredibly difficult bosses at a 1/20 chance each spawn.
If you feel like this is too high, too bad, because I can't
figure out how to use the config.yml.

## FAQ
# How do I get started?

A: Create a Compounder. Everything you need
to create drugs come from the compounder.

# How do I get the Corporate gear?
A: Trade with the Mysterious Trader for Blueprints,
then make a Trading Terminal. You can craft it
in there.

# 我如何在制造甲基安非他明之前取得进展？
甲：创建氰化物，然后制造木头鞋。 右键点击后，它会产生一个初级交易者，你可以 从中获取物品。

# How can I get boss drops?
A: Defeat the respective bosses. The Red Wolves Hook drops from the Red Wolves Gangster,
while the Android core drops from the Corporation Security Robots. You can also get
the Robot armor set from the Corporate Security Robots, which is much more powerful
than the Hazmat set, while much rarer.
